# Activity log: FOUNDIN-PD cell-to-clinic

Progress record for the FOUNDIN-PD (PPMI Project 150) cell-to-clinic analysis. The newest entry is first.

> **Public repository.** This log holds no participant-level information: no PATNOs, cell-line (CDI) numbers, per-line values, credentials or data. Controlled-access data stays on the local machine under `data/`, which is git-ignored.

## 2026-11-12: Data integrity check and structure review

### Done
- **Integrity check:** all 9 processed-data bundles (Project 150 release) were test-read end to end with `tar -tzf`. Every one returned exit code 0 with no errors, and the sizes match the server listing. **No re-download needed** before the Aspera account expires (~2026-12-11).
- File listings and READMEs were extracted to `data/listings/` and `data/readmes/`; both stay local. Nothing else has been unpacked yet.
- Added a `.gitignore` covering `data/` and genomic and single-cell file types.

| Bundle | Tar check | Entries | Contents (summary) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 150.1 GENO | OK | 194 | NeuroChip PLINK set (day 0 + day 65); per-sample CNV PDFs |
| 150.2 PROT | OK | 5 | TMT proteomics: 3 replicate CSVs, **10 lines only** |
| 150.4 METH | OK | 8 | EPIC normalised matrix, probe annotation, QC reports |
| 150.5 HICS | OK | 20 | HiCCUPS loop BEDPEs, **~10 lines** (day 0 / day 65) |
| 150.6 ATAC | OK | 293 | MACS2 peak BEDs, day 0 / 25 / 65 |
| 150.8 SCRN CellRanger | OK | 335 | 83 day-65 runs (filtered + raw `.h5`, web summaries) |
| 150.8 SCRN Seurat | OK | 3 | one integrated object with broad cell types (42.7 GB RDS) |
| 150.9 RNAB | OK | 10 | aggregated bulk RNA tables only (counts / CPM / TPM / VST, circRNA) |
| 150.10 RNAS | OK | 19 | exceRpt small-RNA summaries |

### Findings
- **Sample IDs:** file names encode the PPMI PATNO plus the CDI cell-line suffix, and timepoint and batch (README naming convention). No separate ID-mapping file is needed. The processed data can be joined directly to PPMI clinical data, so the "no outcomes before registration" firewall is procedural only and must be stated in the registration.
- **No sample metadata in the processed bundles.** Sample sheets sit in the RAW folders, which are outside the approval. `ATAC_BED_SAMPLENAMES.txt`, mentioned in the ATAC README, is not in the bundle. Diagnosis, genetic group and batch must come from public Table S1 (Bressan et al. 2023).
- **Line counts:**
  - Day-0 ATAC: 99 samples from 95 distinct lines. Registration wording: **94 donor lines + control line ×5 = 99 samples**.
  - Day-65 scRNA (Cell Ranger): 83 runs from **80 distinct lines** (79 donor lines + control line ×4: batches 1, 3, 5-E6, 5-E8). The earlier working figure was 82, so this needs reconciling with Table S1 and the Seurat metadata before n = 47 PD donors is final.
- **Proteomics (10 lines) and Hi-C (~10 lines)** are too small for donor-level association; at most they can support descriptive or secondary analyses.
- **Compute constraint:** the local machine has 31 GB RAM, and R and PLINK are not installed. The 42.7 GB compressed Seurat RDS will likely need >100 GB RAM to load.

### Open items / next steps
1. Unpack into the local data area. 878 GB is free, so space is not a constraint. Decide whether to unpack the Seurat RDS now.
2. Check the bulk RNA column headers for day-0 samples (counts only).
3. Reconcile the scRNA line count (80 vs 82) with Table S1 and the Seurat metadata.
4. Decide how to handle the Seurat object:
   - (a) use an approved larger-memory environment;
   - (b) request cell-level metadata (cell type, TH+, sample) from LONI / DZNE as a small table;
   - (c) re-annotate from the Cell Ranger `.h5` files in Python.

   This decision feeds the pseudobulk vs cell-level model choice.
5. Email LONI with these questions:
   - approved storage and analysis environment, including larger-memory compute;
   - cells per line;
   - Aspera extension if needed.

   Drop the ID-mapping question: the files are keyed by PATNO.
6. Finish the power simulation, settle the open decisions, then file the OSF pre-registration (secondary-data template, embargoed) and make a tagged GitHub/Zenodo release of the gate scripts.

### Prior exposure (for the registration)
Public paper and Tables S1/S3. Processed data: file listings and README files only. No data matrices have been opened or analysed, and no PPMI clinical outcomes have been pulled.

## 2026-11-11: Data access and download
- PPMI Tier 3 access approved for FOUNDIN-PD Project 150, processed data only (MJFF approval 2026-10-28).
- LONI Aspera access set up; account expires ~2026-12-11.
- All needed processed bundles downloaded 2026-11-11/12. Not downloaded:
  - single-cell ATAC (`150.7_SCAT*`): only if an aim needs it;
  - raw data: outside the approval;
  - the unpacked duplicate of the processed data.
- Only Project 150 processed data is in scope. Other server folders are visible but not approved. Tier 2 Project 233 (phosphoproteomics) would need its own approval.

## Governance rules (standing)
- No linking to PPMI clinical, imaging or SAA outcomes for FOUNDIN PATNOs until the OSF registration is filed.
- Data stays local in an access-restricted location; never upload it to cloud storage or GitHub.
- When using AI assistants: run scripts locally and share only summaries or structure, never participant-level rows or IDs.
